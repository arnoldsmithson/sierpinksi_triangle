# Sierpinski Triangle Code

Not going to lie, I pretty much did this just for fun lol

## Why?

Because I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/historyinmemes/status/1603512970201686016) and my first thought was, "that's cool" and then my second thought was, "I wonder if I could code this?"

## Special Thanks

Thank you to the stack overflow question I found that gave me a handy function to randomly choose a point in a triangle. I only needed it once but god bless you.
